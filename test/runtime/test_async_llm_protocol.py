"""Protocol-conformance guard: ``AsyncLLM`` explicitly inherits
``EngineClient``.

Locks the inheritance as a class-level invariant so a future
refactor cannot silently break protocol conformance by dropping a
base class, renaming a method, or removing an attribute the OpenAI
serving layer depends on.

The check uses ``EngineClient in AsyncLLM.__mro__`` rather than
``issubclass(AsyncLLM, EngineClient)``: ``runtime_checkable``
``Protocol`` classes with attribute members raise ``TypeError:
Protocols with non-method members don't support issubclass()``, and
``EngineClient`` mixes attributes with methods. A direct MRO
membership check works regardless of protocol shape.

Registered on ``runtime-1gpu`` only because the tokenspeed
import graph currently requires a CUDA-capable environment
(``triton`` import); the test itself does not touch the GPU.
