"""Kimi K2 model configuration.

Kimi K2 checkpoints (and their Eagle3 drafts) ship a custom ``model_type`` of
``kimi_k2`` without an ``auto_map`` entry, so ``transformers`` cannot resolve
the config on its own. Structurally the model matches DeepSeek-V3 (MLA + MoE
with ``sigmoid`` / ``noaux_tc`` routing), so we expose a thin subclass that
inherits ``DeepseekV3Config`` and only overrides the registered ``model_type``.
