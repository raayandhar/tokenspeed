"""Sync facade over ``AsyncLLM`` for blocking callers.

A dedicated daemon thread owns a private ``asyncio`` event loop that
drives ``AsyncLLM.generate_request`` coroutines. Sync callers submit
work via ``asyncio.run_coroutine_threadsafe``; streaming callers
consume results through a ``queue.Queue`` with three-valued
semantics (normal item / terminal sentinel / exception) so
exceptions propagate to the caller thread instead of getting
swallowed by the driver loop.

Bridging at this layer — rather than maintaining a separate sync
IPC client — keeps ``AsyncLLM`` single-producer and the scheduler
IPC surface single-caller, while still letting ``Engine`` expose a
blocking API to callers that cannot own an event loop themselves.
